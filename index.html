            <p>I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep getting the iphones i <br> have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a great man and a <br> awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspired me to one day and go for and <br> work with the apple when i get old but my dream is to own Apple and follow <br> by Steve Jobs way and make Apple greater than before it was. But i will <br> dearly miss Steve Jobs he's a great man and I will never forget him.

            <h4>Steve Jobs</h4>
            <p>What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I've written <br> as an adult (and certainly every one that has been published), almost every <br> email I've ever written, has been written on machines created by Apple. I <br> interacted online using an Apple machine long before I ever encountered a <br> PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid. <br> And through his vision, I have been able to realize my own. You'll be <br> missed, Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work

            <p>A part of my heart has cracked. I didn't know him personally but I felt like I <br> knew him. I will forever remember him. I'm still saddened because he was <br> taken too soon. I can only imagine his struggles. Heaven has certainly <br> gained an angel.

For me Apple means a lot - I got a good job using Apple <br> products, I have found a new lifestyle thanks to Apple. And, of course, I've <br> been always admiring your products. And for me everything in Apple is <br> connected with Steve. I do hope he'll be remembered around the world as <br> a genius.
